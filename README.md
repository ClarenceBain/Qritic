# Qritic
A rootless arm64e IOS tweak for the Queue movie app that removes the soft character limit on reviews, comments, and the user bio

# Features:
+ Expands Reviews character limit to 600
+ Expands Comments character limit to 300
+ Expands User Bio character limit to 290
+ Under the Following section of the app, users who are not following you back will have their button colored red
+ Within the Watch Streaks badges, the progress section will now tell you the dates the badges will be rewarded on

This tweak is mostly for personal use so I have no real interest or motivation to add these settings as toggles, if the day comes that _I_ go public with this (r/jailbreak) i'll probably implement some sort of Settings
